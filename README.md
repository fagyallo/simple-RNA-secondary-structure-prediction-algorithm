# RNA_folding_primer
Implement the algorithm discussed in class and described in RNAfolding_primer.pdf.


It should take as its input a nucleotide sequence, .e.g., "AGGCAAAACGUAA",
and produce as its output the optimal secondary structure in parenthesis notation, e.g., "..((....))..."  
and consider the scoring matrix S(G,C) = S(C,G) = S(A,U) = S(U,A) = 1 and S(i,j) = 0 else.
